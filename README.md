 This is the README file for "https://github.com/Jon-R-Sauer" which currently contains the
 repository "sim_nanopore". In turn, this contains a compressed .pdf file with a technical
 memo on the simulation of a inverted cone nanopore with fluid containing biomolecules
 driven through it by electro-osmosis.  Soon it will contain a .tar.gz file conatining the
 FreeFem++ code to perform the simulation.
