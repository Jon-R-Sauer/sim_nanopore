 This is the README file for "https://github.com/Jon-R-Sauer" which currently
 contains the repository "sim_nanopore". In turn, this includes .pdf files with
 a technical memo on the simulation of a inverted cone nanopore with fluid
 containing biomolecules driven through it by electro-osmosis.  It also contains
 .tar.gz files containing the FreeFem++ code to perform the simulation.
